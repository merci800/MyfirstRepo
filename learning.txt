so far in this course, I have learned how to use Git and GitHub for version control. I now understand how to initialize a repository, commit changes, create branches, and push my work to a remote repository. I have also learned how to collaborate with others using forks and pull requests, which is very useful for teamwork and managing code effectively.
This knowledge has made me more confident in managing my projects and tracking my progress systematically.
